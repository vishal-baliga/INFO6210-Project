# INFO6210-Project
Database for a Cloud Computing platform


This was the capstone project built for the course Data Management and Datatbase Design - INFO6210, under the guidance of Prof. Wuping Wang.

Collaborators Include - KirthiKumar Waykos, Kruthi Nymisha Kona and Ramya Hebbar from Northeastern campus's in Boston, Silicon valley and Seattle campuses respectively.
We have designed and maintained this database from strach till it's completion on Microsoft SQL Server.



Database Purpose:
This is an extensive database that be implemented by a company which provides cloud resources to its user base using PaaS and pay-per-usage business model. It's assumed that it provides it's users capabilities to rent virtual machines to execute code for computer applications and computations. It serves the purpose of maintaining the cloud resources of the company like MachineImages, Instances, Storage etc. It also provides security by encrypting sensitive information like Userâ€™s Passwords and their Card Details. It automatically creates a bill and executes a transaction once the user stops using the machine. It is built with the intuition that the users have the ability to configure their own virtual machines and request for additional infrastructure for a specified price. Overall, this database facilitates data collection, processing, billing, transactions and reporting of various processes in this business environment.

We have implemented several stored procedures, functions, triggers and encryption in this process.


All the essential documents like the ER Diagram, Design Document, SQL implementation files are are also available.



Super stoked to finish this project with the team and looking foward to designing and building complex Databases/Data Warehouses in the future.
